# Parameter-Optimization-of-SVM
This is a mini-project to optimize the SVM of different samples and reports the best parameters

## SVM (Support Vector Machine) 

One of the most popular supervised learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine, or SVM, is used to solve Classification and Regression problems. However, it is mainly used to solve Machine Learning Classification problems.

It is possible to alter several of the most crucial SVM parameters, including kernel, C, and gamma, to increase accuracy.This is called as Hyperparameter Tuning.

I've used a Fitness Function in this Python notebook to optimise the parameters.

## Dataset

The dataset for the project has been downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone)

The age of abalone can be inferred from physical measurements using this dataset. Cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings under a microscope are the tedious and time-consuming steps involved in determining the age of an abalone. The age is predicted using other metrics that are simpler to get. To fix the issue, other details might be needed, such as weather patterns and location (and, consequently, food supply).

## Discussion

The graph is made for the sample which has best accuracy. Sample 3 has the best accuracy of 0.28 having kernel = rbf, Nu = 5.03 and Epsilon = 1.17
